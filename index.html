          <p>This overnight pet sitting service provides your pet with the comfort, 
            companionship, and security of having a dedicated caregiver stay in your home throughout the night. 
            This service is ideal for pets who thrive on routine, need extra attention, 
            or simply feel more at ease in their own familiar environment.</p>
          <p>During stays, I will arrive in the evening and remain overnight, 
            ensuring your pet receives continuous care, affection, and supervision.

            medication administration, playtime, and plenty of cuddles. I'll also keep an eye on household 
            tasks like bringing in mail, adjusting lights, watering plants, 
            and maintaining your home’s lived-in appearance for added security.</p>
          <p>Throughout the stay, you’ll receive updates and photos so you can relax 
            knowing your pet is safe, comfortable, and enjoying their time with a trusted companion</p>
          <p><strong>Perfect For:</strong> Pets with separation anxiety, senior pets, puppies, multi-pet households, 
            and travelers who want their home looked after as well. Reliable overnight care that

          <p>Our 30-minute dog walking and drop-in service is designed to give your pet the perfect blend of exercise,
             attention, and comfort while you’re away. Whether your dog needs a brisk walk to burn off energy 
             or a friendly check-in during the day, we tailor each visit to their individual needs.</p>
          <p>During a <strong>dog walk</strong>, your pup will enjoy a safe, engaging stroll around your neighborhood, 
            complete with sniff breaks, a steady pace, and plenty of positive reinforcement. 
             I'll ensure fresh water is provided and offer treats if allowed.</p>
          <p>For <strong>drop-in visits</strong>, I can handle feeding, water refresh, potty breaks, 
            litter box checks, medication administration (if needed), and of course — playtime and affection. 
            I'll make sure your pet feels relaxed, cared for, and not alone.</p>
            <p>Every visit includes a quick update with notes and photos so you can feel connected and reassured knowing your pet is happy.</p>
            <p><strong>Perfect For:</strong> Midday breaks, busy workdays, vacation support, 
              senior pets, puppies, and pets with special routines. Reliable care, happy pets, peace of mind — all in 30 minutes.</p>
